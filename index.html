            It's been a rough 2 years because of the pandemic but hey, you made it through to another year. I like to
            think
            that every new year is like a level up in game. You grow and get stronger with the challenges you face.
            Dont be too disappointed if you havent figure out your life yet. Take it slow. Be patient.
            Unlike what most people think it is never too late to be what you wish to be. You have another 5,6,7 years
            more
            to live. You still have time to try a lot of stuffs. I would also like to encourage you to spend your money
            more on experience
            than possesion.
        </p>

            Every day is a new opportunity. A new year is like a blank book and the pen is in your hand. It is your
            chance to write a beautiful story for your future self to look back proudly. Happy New Year.
